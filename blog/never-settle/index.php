                     <p>Welcome to my humble abode, my new home, my shiny new website.<br><br>

                      I'm sure any designer will agree, designing for yourself is an impossible task. The final results are often just a small detail of what was a painfully long process in which they battled with color, typography, layout, case studies, writing, and everything else someone should, or should not display in their personal space. There are many questions that pop up, and many that will stay un-answered.<br><br>

                      I've came to accept that there is no right answer or approach to this process, and that a personal website will always be an evolutionary process, with no final product. The key to a successful personal website, is to never settle. Personal websites are for our own self-satisfaction, and to show others what we are capable off when let free from the shackles of clients. It is a selfish place to show off our capabilities and talk about ourselves; it’s also a place to be proud of. Often, looking back on our client work we will argue that we should have changed 'x' or 'y' - here, we can change those elements, we can ultimately get near to what we feel is the perfect design.<br><br>

                      Perhaps, the problem here is that as designers we require a helping hand to initially guide us the right way. Without a brief, we are left lost, not knowing which direction to take. This is the problem I had; I needed to know which direction I should head towards The answer though, quite simply was, <i>'what is this website for?'</i><br><br>

                      This site is a space for me to explore. It will be a place for truth, and a place for learning. Our community is moving fast, and to keep a place in this race we have to keep on battling, never settling. Even if you don't see my experiment-taking place here, it’s a place for me to tinker. Tinkering is important, it teaches us.<br><br>

                      Very soon, you may be looking at a completely new website, or perhaps reading this in a new typeface, simply so I can please the selfish perfectionist that I am. This website will change, it will show development, and soon I will look back on my work baffled by the designer I once was. Personal development is very important, designers cant just settle, they must continue to adapt and evolve. That's what I love so much about been a designer, the constant self-questioning, and the challenges.<br><br>

                      In conclusion, I could have kept this space just as it was before - a description of the person I am, nothing more. But I want to learn, and I will learn. Welcome to my new website, a place for learning, a place for self-development, and a home for my work to hang on the walls. I quite like this version, lets see how long it lasts...
