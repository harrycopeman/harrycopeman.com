				<h2>üëã<br><br>Hey, I'm Harry - a product designer living in London, designing and prototyping good things with good people.<br><br>

				I‚Äôm currently leading design at <a href="https://farewill.com/">Farewill</a>, a weird and wonderful company trying to change the way people prepare for and deal with death.<br><br>
				
				Previous to that, I worked at <a href="https://facebook.com/">Facebook</a> London, where I spent almost two years designing tools to help small businesses succeed. At Facebook I also designed and supported internal and external design tools that looked to improve workflows.<br><br>

				Before joining Facebook, I freelanced for various companies including <a href="https://dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>, where I designed and built part of the Mailbox website to help them scale across new platforms. Other teams I've worked with include SeatGeek and Switch.<br><br>

				In 2012 I won the D&AD New Blood Award, and in 2015 I was nominated for the Net Awards Young Designer of the Year.<br><br>

				If you want to chat about design, bikes, or anything else then drop me an email.<br><br>
