            <p>I’m Harry Copeman, a product designer from Hull, England. I’m passionate about simplifying and improving the tools that humans interact with everyday. I sweat over pixels, typography and code — and if I’m not at my desk, I’ll be riding my bike.</p>

            <p>I’m currently freelancing, solving various challenges for my clients. Previous to this, I was the co-founder of a digital studio we called <a href="http://cyclestudios.co/" target="_blank">Cycle Studios</a>. I’m now looking to join a team full time — you can have a read of Résume <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/w38vg5upwhm74eq/Harry%20Copeman%20R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, or take a look at <a href="../portfolio">my work</a>.</p>

            <p>Away from the screen I spend most of my time with my girlfriend Cara, or turning the gears on my bike through the countryside.<br><br>

              Feel free to stalk me on <a href="https://twitter.com/harrycopeman">Twitter</a>, or stay up to date with what I’m working on via <a href="https://dribbble.com/harrycopeman">Dribbble</a>. I’m always up for a chat too - <a href="mailto:harry.copeman@gmail.com">harry.copeman@gmail.com</a>.</p>

            <p>Take it easy.</p>
