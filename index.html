        I’m Harry Copeman, a British software designer based in New York, currently working at OpenAI.
        Over the last decade or so I’ve helped build consumer products across a mix of startups and
        larger teams. I left college to join Dropbox, then joined the design team at Facebook. I was the
        founding designer at Farewill (acquired), before helping open the London office for Bakken &
        Baeck. Most recently, I led design at Cosmos, a platform for creatives to collect and curate
        inspiration. Before that, I led Discovery and AI at Shop, and worked on creation tools at
        Universe.
