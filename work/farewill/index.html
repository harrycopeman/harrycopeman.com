      <p>Writing a will is boring and expensive, which probably explains why 97% of people die without an up to date will. Farewill exists to make writing your will easy and affordable, and to cut the bullshit out of legal services. For the last 6 months I’ve led design at Farewill, in that time we've shipped an entire re-design of the product, and a re-brand of the company.</p>
      <h2>Building the Product</h2>
      <p>Over time lawyers have made writing your will a long, expensive, and complicated process, so I set out to find out why. We started in people’s homes asking them what they thought a will was, and ended up writing our own wills with a solicitor. We worked out the small details and the large problems.<br><br>
      From there we broke the process out into the 4 key points of writing your will, and then built out 4 separate flows that supported people through a series of jargon free questions.

      <p class="caption">We kept questions per page to a minimum, and always had supporting text on hand</p>

      <p class="caption">Part of the simple onboarding</p>
      <p>Another interesting finding was that people always wanted to take their time with their will, their was no real motivation to get it finished and signed once they’d started. I explored how we could ‘gamify’ the process, to make people feel rewarded as they went through their will. This gave me the opportunity to work with <a href="http://frederiquematti.com/">Frederique Matti</a> on a series of illustrations that would encourage people to continue writing their will.</p>

      <h2>Creating a Brand</h2>
      <p>In order to get people to want to interact with our great product, we needed a visual identity that would invite people in. In December we sat out to work with the good folk at <a href="https://www.studiokoto.co/">Koto</a>, the creators of brands such as Airbnb, Fanta & Superhi, on a visual re-brand.</p>

      <p>After initial discussions it was clear that we wanted something stand out & memorable, something bold but not too aggressive. Initial explorations looked at each end of the spectrum — one was soft and fluid, whilst the other was bold and provocative. Neither felt quite right, so we continued to work on something that sit in the middle.</p>
