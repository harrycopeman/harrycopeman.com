      <p>One of the biggest pain points for business owners was having the ability to sell their products on Facebook, from start to finish. They had their products on Facebook, but how did they then go on to successfully advertise those products? And if someone does respond to their post, how do they complete a transaction on mobile?</p>
      <h2>What to build</h2>
      <p>After seeing what the north star could look like, we began turning our attention to the starting point of this journey —  letting business owners share their products in an easy way. Initial research taught us that people didn’t just want to upload a picture of a t-shirt, they wanted to tell a creative story. Richer creative formats, would in theory drive more sales.</p>

      <p>Having a north star in mind we ran several research sessions, initially in London and eventually in Vietnam. It was a good opportunity to test various interactions and entry points to tag your products.</p>

      <p>Working on a product that would effect ad formats, also meant I had time to focus on the consumer side of Facebook. I worked closely with the news feed team, taking trips to SF, and working out an experience that felt great for consumers, and didn’t hurt those crazy news feed metrics.</p>
      <h2>The Result</h2>
      <p>We introduced product tagging to all business in emerging countries, with a slow rollout across Android devices. Uptake was strong, as was revenue growth.</p>
