        <h2 class='heading-two'>The problem</h2>
        <p>EBT was an existing application, with some big problems. The idea of this application was to help users reduce stress levels by inputting their feelings, and socialising with others. An application helping users calm down shouldn’t be hard work to use, it should be bright and quick.  My task was to simplify this product into something that users would enjoy opening everyday.</p>

        </div>

        <h2 class='heading-two'>Re-Thinking the Experience</h2>
        <p>The biggest challenge was to re-think the existing user experience, but subtly in order to keep current users on board. I also had the challenge of bringing new features to the application like a social feed, notifications, and actions steps. It was clear we needed to strip away a lot of the unnecessary weight from the application. Elements like a brain detailing where the stress was coming from were eventually cut from the app and made way to a new focal point; a social point where users would check in and share stories. This would promote encouragement and therefore motivation among users.</p>

        <h2 class='heading-two'>Style</h2>
        <p>The current interface had a lot of shadows and dark colours; it had too much weight, and was too dull. Subconsciously, I wanted to design an environment that would ‘lighten up’ the user. The style guide I designed including a lot of bright, soft colours, and avoided any harsh tones.</p>

        </div>

        <h2 class='heading-two'>Interactions</h2>
        <p>Interaction would also prove to be a very important feature of this app. It was clear the experience needed to feel quick. My hope was for users to get a notification from their phone reminding them to check in, and they should be able to complete the whole process in under 20 seconds. Anything longer, and I would have designing a frustrating experience that would turn users away.</p>

        <h2 class='heading-two'>A Personal Home</h2>
        <p>Much like the social networks of today, we wanted to create an environment where users could encourage one and other. Upon sign up users are placed within a small group of people similar to themselves, with a professional to advice and encourage everyone. Below is the main feed and notifications.</p>

        </div>

        <h2 class='heading-two'>Walkthrough</h2>
        <p>To help users navigate the application, I designed a series of screens to onboard new users, so they could get up and running right away. It was essential users entered their details among a sign up so we could place them within an appropriate group.</p>

        </div>

        <h2 class='heading-two'>Simplifying</h2>
        <p>One of the biggest design challenges was creating a flow of screens that users would have to walk through each time they entered their stress level. After entering a level, they would then be presented with a series of appropriate steps. Below shows one of several paths a user could take.</p>
