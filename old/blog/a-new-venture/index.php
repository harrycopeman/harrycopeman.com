              				<p>2014 is off to a very busy but exciting start. I'm now the co-founder of <a href="http://cyclestudios.co">Cycle Studios</a>, working alongside <a href="https://twitter.com/will_lenzenjr">this guy</a>. The freelance life was great, I had the ability to work on different projects, in my own time. But I missed that opportunity to bounce of others and actually having the opportunity to turn my crazy ideas into some sort of reality is something I always wanted. <br><br>

                      <a href="http://cyclestudios.co">Cycle Studios</a> is a creative agency helping brands tell their story, whether it be through a pretty website, a new logo or an awesome video that Will produces. In a way, I still get to do exactly what I was doing 2 months ago, but I have the opportunity to work with another talented guy or two. We are also building our own products from the agency, there are some huge ideas in place and to be honest we don't know where to start. It’s been a challenge so far, we have our first client on board and that’s a very exciting opportunity. But we are always wanting to expand, develop our own ideas and push our website ever forward into this perfect space that every designer is going to drool over. Now and then we have to take a step back and focus on the smaller things.<br><br>

                      The website was a huge task, I'm a designer that can never settle with a design, I was designing & coding something then going back a week later with a list of stuff I wanted to change, thank god Will was on board to tell me to slow down. Its not ever going to be finished in my eyes, I've updated something small every day for the past month now, fact.  <br><br>

                    Its crazy. Just a month in there's about 20 ideas of our own we want to build on, plus 1000 company opportunities we want to take; its a learning curve making the correct decisions. Go over and take a look at <a href="http://cyclestudios.co">Cycle Studios</a>, let me know what you think of the website and please do share us on Twitter.</p>
