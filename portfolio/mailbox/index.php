            <p>My role was to lead the re-design and re-development of the Mailbox help section, to help accommodate for their new desktop application; and to allow for further language support. I also had the opportunity to help the team out with illustrations and user guides.<br><br>With the launch of Mailbox for Mac imminent, the site needed to support the needs of users looking to get familiar with the application. There was also some issues regarding device priorities. The first point of action was to identify how users would flow through the site. Initially, we worked from some very rough user flows, to agree on how users should navigate through the site.</p>

            <p>Further sketches also lead to some quick HTML & JS prototypes. The two videos below demonstrate some early ideas for the 'Tips + Tricks' and 'Getting Started' sections. We needed a way to cut down on long articles, and instead create an intuitive experience. Scroll indicators seemed like a smart solution as they allow users to quickly point to a section if they wished.</p>

              <p>With some help from Ryan Putman on this amazing set of icons, we had a page to be pretty excited about. We also brought the sites other pages up to scratch with the help section.</p>

            <p>With the help of <a target='_blank' href='https://twitter.com/kevinewe\'>Kevin</a> I also put the code together for the new help section. By using AJAX we make it easy for the user operations team to add further languages down the line. The rest of the site was HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
