        <h2 class='heading-two'>The brief</h2>
        <p>Outria is a web application allowing users to see events taking place around them. They also have the ability to view smaller details like the percentage of male/female, and whom of their Facebook friends would be attending. My job was to completely re-think Outria for the mobile environment.</p>

        <div class="break"></div>

        <h2 class='heading-two'>The Problem</h2>
        <p>Having a web application allowed the majority of features to be at the forefront of the application, something that couldn’t be done on a smaller, mobile environment. I needed to create a solution that would fit a lot of features, into a small environment; without compromising the experience for users.</p>

        </div>

        <h2 class='heading-two'>Early Ideas</h2>
        <p>The first call of action was to prioritize features. I set upon designing a set of user flows that made navigation easy, common features accessible and the whole application intuitive. A big I encountered was the large number of navigation elements on the web application. Below shows some initial sketches to explain the user flows.</p>

        </div>

        <h2 class='heading-two'>A New Experience</h2>
        <p>After deciding on which features would take a back step, I began to work further into the details of the app, and how I would make the most of the challenging environment I was given. By adding interactivity (swipes, shakes, etc.) we could reduce the number of popups slowing the experience down.</p>

        </div>

        <h2 class='heading-two'>Style</h2>
        <p>A strong experience now needed a style guide, which proved to be rather simple. The brand already had a strong color pallet and direction; I just needed to make some small changes in order to make the application bright enough, and readable on a smaller screen. </p>

        <h2 class='heading-two'>Finishing Touches</h2>
        <p>I worked closely with the team to finalize user interactions and flows, until we had a very solid set of wireframes and style’s. With a framework in place, I began piecing together the pieces for the Outria application. Below are several screens from my final submission.</p>
