             <h2 class="heading-two">The Brief</h2>
             <p>Network marketing has a bad reputation for a lack of communication and encouragement among team members. Our job here was to design a product that would help solve this problem. The plan was to design an environment that would keep team members not only in touch with one and other, but also in the loop with what work others are doing.</p>

             <h2 class="heading-two">Identifying the problems</h2>
             <p>I find the best way to design a solution is by first identifying the main pain points. After doing some user research it was clear to see the majority of users would be aged 30-50, with little tech experience. We clearly needed to design something that didn’t complicate things - it should just make sense; no dressing it up bullshit. The first call of action was to get some simple flows together as to how this thing should work. Below are some early sketches.</p>

            </div>


             <h2 class="heading-two">User Experience</h2>
             <p>After creating some basic user flows on pen and paper we then began working on some digital wireframes to piece together the experience. This included various revisions, and many prototypes - allowing us to put ourselves in the users shoes. We also ran a couple of tests on people outside of the project to see what they thought of the experience.</p>

             <h2 class="heading-two">Style Guide</h2>
             <p>Each element of TreeTender needed to feel obvious; it was vital we didn’t go over board with designs, we just needed something that the products audience could understand. We created a set of crystal clear icons, info graphics, and a colour palette that would sit nicely with users. Will also did some great work on the branding of TreeTender.</p>

            <h2 class="heading-two">Designing Data</h2>
            <p>One of the biggest challenges of the project was carefully crafting the high amounts of data users are presented with. By delaying animations in order of importance we could consciously show users where the eye needs to go first. Here's one test, which would hopefully draw users in.</p>

             <h2 class="heading-two">The Design Proccess</h2>
             <p>The design process took us through many directions and iterations. Below are just some of the designs we went through on the main dashboard, and the problems we encountered. The main problems where over designing, and complicated things much more than they needed to be.</p>

            <p>Below are all of the final screens submitted to the client. I’m very happy with the product we created, and once developed I’m hoping that TreeTender will change network marketing.</p>
