        <p>Popcam was originally to created to be a fun, and easy to use application for a young audience. When I was given the task of re-designing Popcam, it clearly had many problems in both functionality and appearance. I re-designed the experience, interface, iconography and application icon for Popcam in late 2013. A promotional website was also designed for the brief. Popcam is <a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/popcam-camera/id565858493?mt=8' target="_blank">available in the app store</a></p>

        <h2 class='heading-two'>Sharing</h2>
        <p>Sharing images is obviously an integral part of this application. The flow from a user taking a picture, to sharing it with a caption needed to be done as quickly and as simply as possible. Below is the final flow of how sharing works.</p>

        <h2 class='heading-two'>In App Purchases</h2>
        <p>One of Popcam’s main features is that it offers in app purchases to users; often-fun sticker or filter picks. However the previous flow was confusing, it wasn’t intuitive. By speeding up the flow to just a few clicks it made the application feel much lighter.</p>

        <h2 class='heading-two'>Details</h2>
        <p class="case-caption">Some of the finer details make Popcam a much better, holistic application for the users. Things like a social bar with deals and upcoming birthdays, and easy access to contacts make it a personal experience.</p>

        <h2 class='heading-two'>Icon</h2>
        <p class="case-caption">Popcam also needed a new icon, to get away from the skeuomorphism of iOS6 and to move forward into iOS7. I don’t pride myself to be much of an icon designer, but Popcam was looking for the simplest icon it could suitably have.</p>

        <h2 class='heading-two'>Website</h2>
        <p class="case-caption">Finally, Popcam needed a home. Below is an idea of how the upcoming website is planned to look.</p>
